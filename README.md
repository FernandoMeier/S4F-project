This is a repository for my final "Script4Fun" project. 

##  What's this about?
This is a free version of the Website `https://www.quizlet.com/`, because I believe that good learning-tools should be free for everyone and not hidden behind a paywall. 

## Navigation:
* [home_menu](#home_menu)
* [flashcards](#flashcards)
* [learn](#learn)
* [test_site](#test_site)
* [saved_data](#saved_data)

## home_menu
This is the directory where the home menu (where the user will first be when entering the website) is located.

## flashcards
This is the directory where the entire script for the "Learn" mode is saved.
